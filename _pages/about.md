## About Me

I am a university student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University. My primary interests span AI, cryptography, and software engineering, areas in which I have actively engaged through various research projects and internships.

Previously, I studied at the Korea Science Academy of KAIST, graduating in the top 10% of my class.

I am always eager to embrace new challenges and seek opportunities that allow me to grow and make meaningful contributions.
